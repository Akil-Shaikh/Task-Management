# Task-Management
    Project Title: Task Management System
    Description:
    Developed a Task Management System using Python, SQLite, and Tkinter. This application allows users to add tasks with due dates, mark tasks as complete, and displays tasks categorized as pending or completed.

# Technologies:
    Languages: Python
    Libraries: SQLite3, Tkinter
    Modules: datetime
# Features:
    Task Addition: Users can add tasks with due dates, ensuring dates are in the future.
    Task Completion: Ability to mark tasks as complete with current date stamp.
    Display: Displays pending tasks and completed tasks, highlighting late completions.

# Is it a task management system or todo list?
    The application created functions more like a task management system rather than a simple todo list. Here's why:

    Task Management System: Typically includes features for adding tasks with detailed information such as due dates, completion statuses, and sometimes additional metadata. It allows for marking tasks as complete, displaying tasks categorized by status (incomplete vs. complete), and often supports sorting or filtering tasks based on various criteria.
    
    Todo List: Usually simpler, focusing on listing tasks without extensive details or categorization. Todo lists often lack features like marking tasks as complete with timestamps or displaying tasks in separate categories based on status.
    
    Based on the functionality and features you've implemented (such as adding tasks with due dates, marking tasks as complete with date stamps, and displaying tasks categorized as pending or completed), your application aligns more closely with a task management system. This distinction implies a more comprehensive approach to organizing and managing tasks compared to a basic todo list.
